# Hi there, I'm Tom! 👋

**Engineering Student (M.Eng) & Mathematics Student (B.Sc)**

I am a passionate developer based in Paris, currently pursuing a double degree at **Télécom Paris** (top-tier French Engineering School) and **Sorbonne Université**.

My focus is on **Data Science, AI, and Cybersecurity**, but I also have a strong background in pure Mathematics. I love building things from scratch, whether it's a game engine tool, a neural network, or a full-stack web app.

## Featured Projects

Here are some of the projects I've built recently:

### **[LLM Transformer from Scratch](https://tom-effernelli.vercel.app/project-page-dev-small-llm)**
> *Deep Learning / NLP / PyTorch*
* Implemented a Large Language Model based on the "Attention Is All You Need" paper.
* Built the full Transformer architecture with multi-head self-attention mechanisms.

### **[Stochastic Texture Generator](https://tom-effernelli.vercel.app/project-page-dev-stochastic-texture)**
> *Computer Graphics / Algorithms*
* A tool for procedural texture synthesis solving tiling issues on large surfaces.
* Uses stochastic processes to blend source textures into seamless materials.

### **[Personal Portfolio](https://tom-effernelli.vercel.app)**
> *Web Development / Design*
* Responsive portfolio built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
